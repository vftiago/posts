# Article Topics

Candidate topics extracted from ambiguities flagged in other articles.

## Pending

- **Host objects vs native objects in JavaScript** — What are host objects? How do they differ from objects created by JavaScript code? What does the ECMAScript specification say?
  - Source: [why-does-react-use-a-virtual-dom](drafts/why-does-react-use-a-virtual-dom.md)

- **The browser rendering pipeline** — Style calculation, layout/reflow, paint, composite. What triggers each step? What's the relative cost? How do browsers optimize?
  - Source: [why-does-react-use-a-virtual-dom](drafts/why-does-react-use-a-virtual-dom.md)

- **Layout thrashing** — Concrete examples of read/write interleaving, how to detect it with DevTools, patterns to avoid it.
  - Source: [why-does-react-use-a-virtual-dom](drafts/why-does-react-use-a-virtual-dom.md)

- **React's reconciliation algorithm** — The O(n) heuristics, the role of key props, why comparing by reference matters, and the tradeoffs React makes.
  - Source: [why-does-react-use-a-virtual-dom](drafts/why-does-react-use-a-virtual-dom.md)

- **React's render phase vs commit phase** — What happens in each phase, why the distinction matters for performance, and how concurrent features relate.
  - Source: [why-does-react-use-a-virtual-dom](drafts/why-does-react-use-a-virtual-dom.md)

- **What React 19 changed about memoization** — How the React Compiler affects manual memoization patterns (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`), what's still relevant, and what's now obsolete.
  - Source: [why-does-react-use-a-virtual-dom](drafts/why-does-react-use-a-virtual-dom.md)

- **VDOM-less frameworks (Svelte, SolidJS)** — How do frameworks that compile away the Virtual DOM achieve performance? What tradeoffs do they make? Also covers downsides of the VDOM approach: memory overhead, diffing cost, GC pressure.
  - Source: [why-does-react-use-a-virtual-dom](drafts/why-does-react-use-a-virtual-dom.md)

- **How modern JavaScript engines manage garbage collection** — Reference counting vs. mark-and-sweep, generational GC, V8's Orinoco collector, incremental and concurrent marking, and how these strategies affect application performance.
  - Source: [five-javascript-interview-questions-answered-in-depth](drafts/five-javascript-interview-questions-answered-in-depth.md)

- **What problem do React state management libraries solve?** — What gaps in React's built-in state primitives do libraries like Redux and Zustand address? Potential spin-off comparing specific libraries (Redux, Zustand, and a third) if the main article gets too long.
